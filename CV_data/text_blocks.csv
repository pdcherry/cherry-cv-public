intro,"PhD scientist skilled in data visualization, statistical modeling, bioinformatics, biological data science, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and tool-building. I've coded reproducible and rigorous pipelines for high-throughput experimental designs and multi-omic analyses for communication to technical and non-technical audiences. I've launched best-in-class oncology reference standards, and invented new molecular methods for DNA and microbe manipulation. Originally trained in Molecular Biology, I am passionate about advancing data science and bioinformatics to improve human health and biotechnology."
intro_onco_omics,"PhD scientist skilled in bioinformatics, biological data science, data visualization, statistical modeling, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and tool-building. I've coded reproducible and rigorous pipelines for high-throughput experimental designs and multi-omic analyses, launched best-in-class oncology reference standards, and invented new molecular methods for DNA and microbe manipulation. Originally trained in Molecular Biology, I'm interested in taking my knowledge and practice of bioinformatics and biological data science to the next level, especially in oncology biology and multi-omics."
intro_inactive_RNA,"PhD scientist skilled in RNA biochemistry, next-generation sequencing (NGS), bioinformatics, biological data science, data visualization, and tool-building. I've invented highly multiplexed RNA and DNA methods, coded reproducible and rigorous pipelines for high-throughput experimental designs and genomic analyses, and launched best-in-class oncology reference standards. Originally trained in Molecular Biology, I'm interested in taking my knowledge and practice of RNA biology and bioinformatics to the next level."

industy_experience_aside,I currently split my time between wet lab and computational activities. I have worked in a variety of roles ranging from HTP strain onboarding to genomics scientist. I like collaborative environments where I can learn from my peers and in turn teach others.
research_experience_aside,"I worked on a few projects during my PhD, and the RNA repair project led me to custom 5Â´-OH RNA-seq libraries, which inspired my fascination with transcriptomics and bioinformatics."
intellectual_property_aside,"Working at Twist and Zymergen on new product research requires confidentiality, but public evidence of accomplishments often comes in patent applications. The Legal teams know me well for being a helpful expert in the process."
selected_publications_aside,"I communicate my results clearly, both in writing and in live presentations. I enjoy writing research papers, but my career has required more tech notes and app notes recently."
presentations_aside,I give audience-centered presentations by adapting on the fly and over time to the venue and occasion. I like to *transfer knowledge* by giving methods/best practices talks whose slides can also serve as documentation.
trainees_reports_aside,"While I've not held a role with a ""manager"" title, all Scientist positions I've accepted have had formal report management responsibility. I take managing and mentoring seriously and emphasize trust, learning, and growth with my reports."
