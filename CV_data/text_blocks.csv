intro,"PhD scientist skilled in molecular biology, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and tool-building. I've launched best-in-class oncology reference standards, invented new molecular methods for DNA and microbe manipulation, and coded high-throughput experimental designs and genomic analyses. I'm interested in taking my knowledge and practice of data science and bioinformatics to the next level."
intro_inactive,"PhD scientist skilled in molecular biology, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and tool-building. I've launched best-in-class oncology reference standards, invented new molecular methods for DNA and microbe manipulation, and coded high-throughput sample logistics and genomic analyses. I'm interested in taking my knowledge and practice of NGS assays and bioinformatics to the next level."
industy_experience_aside,I have worked in a variety of roles ranging from HTP strain onboarding to R&D scientist. I like collaborative environments where I can learn from my peers and in turn teach others.
research_experience_aside,"I worked on a few projects during my PhD, and the RNA repair project led me to custom 5'-OH RNA-seq libraries, which inspired my fascination with transcriptomics and bioinformatics."
intellectual_property_aside,"Working at Twist and Zymergen on product research requires confidentiality, but public evidence of accomplishments often comes in patent applications. The Legal teams know me well for being a helpful expert in the process."
selected_publications_aside,"I communicate my results clearly, both in writing and in live presentations. I enjoy writing research papers, but my career has required more tech and app notes recently."
presentations_aside,I give audience-centered presentations by adapting on the fly and over time to the venue and occasion. I like to *transfer knowledge* by giving methods/best practices talks whose slides can also serve as documentation.
trainees_reports_aside,"While I've never been in a ""manager"" position, all Scientist positions I've accepted have had formal report management responsibility. I take managing and mentoring seriously and emphasize trust, learning, and growth with my reports."
